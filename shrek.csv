Narrator," ""Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love’s first kiss.''"
Narrator," ''She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.''"
Narrator, ''She waited in the dragon’s keep....in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love....

Shrek, Like that’s ever gonna happen. [It confirms that the man is in an outhouse] What a load of-- [toilet flushes]

Shrek," [Laughs] Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres. They’re much worse. They’ll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. (Ogre Hunter 4: No!) They’ll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it’s quite good on toast."
Shrek," [whispers] This is the part where you run away. (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. It reads:) ""Wanted. Fairy tale creatures"". (He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder. The next day)"
Guard, All right. This one’s full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
Head guard, Next!
Guard, (taking the witch’s broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half)
Captain of the Guards, That’s 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!
Guard, Get up! Come on!
Captain of the Guards, 20 pieces.
Guard, [thudding] Sit down there! Keep quiet!
Little Bear, [crying] This cage is too small.
Donkey," Please, don’t turn me in. I’ll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!"
Old Woman," Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope) Donkey: Oh!"
Captain of the Guards, Next! What have you got?
Gepetto, This little wooden puppet.
Pinocchio, I’m not a puppet. I’m a real boy. (his nose grows)
Captain of the Guards, Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.
Pinocchio," Father, please! Don’t let them do this! Help me!"
Captain of the Guards, Next! What have you got?
Old Woman," Well, I’ve got a talking donkey."
Captain of the Guards," Right. Well, that’s good for ten shillings, if you can prove it."
Old Woman," Oh, go ahead, little fella. [Donkey just looks up at her.]"
Captain of the Guards, Well?
Old Woman," Oh, oh, he’s just… he’s just a little nervous. He’s really quite a chatterbox. (to Donkey) Talk, you boneheaded dolt-!"
Captain of the Guards, That’s it. I’ve heard enough. Guards!
Old Woman," No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to talk. I’m the talkingest thing you ever saw."
Captain of the Guards, Get her out of my sight.
Old Woman," No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!"
Donkey, Hey! I can fly!
Peter Pan, He can fly!
All, He can fly!
Captain of the Guards, He can talk!
Donkey," Ha, ha! That’s right, fool! Now I’m a flying, talking Donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly, but I bet you ain’t never seen a Donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)"
Captain of the Guards, Seize him! (Donkey takes off running.) After him!
Guards, He's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn! [Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He quickly hides behind Shrek.]
Captain of the Guards, You there. Ogre!
Shrek, Aye?
Captain of the Guards, By the order of Lord Farquaad [he opens a scroll revealing the Farquaad logo] I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility.
Shrek," Oh, really? You and what army?"
Donkey," Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin’ back here. Incredible!"
Shrek, Are you talkin’ to…(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa!
Donkey," Yes. I was talkin’ to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin’ over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that."
Shrek," Oh, that’s great. Really."
Donkey," Man, it’s good to be free."
Shrek," Now, why don’t you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?"
Donkey," But, uh, I don’t have any friends. And I’m not goin’ out there by myself."
Donkey," Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I’ll stick with you. You’re mean, green, fightin’ machine. Together we’ll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us."
Donkey," Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don’t mind me sayin’, if that don’t work, your breath certainly will get the job done, ‘cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, ‘cause you breath stinks!"
Donkey," Man, you almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time…(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) …then I ate some rottenberries. Man, I had some strong gases leaking out of my butt that day."
Shrek, Why are you following me?
Donkey, I'll tell you why. (singing) ♪ 'Cause I'm all alone ♪ There's no one here beside me ♪ My problems have all gone ♪ There's no one to deride me ♪ But you gotta have friends-- ♪
Shrek, Stop singing!!! It’s no wonder you don’t have any friends.
Donkey, Wow. Only a true friend would be that truly honest.
Shrek," Listen, little Donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?"
Donkey, (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uhhhh... Really tall?
Shrek," No! I’m an ogre. You know. ""Grab your torch and pitchforks."" Doesn’t that bother you?"
Donkey, Nope.
Shrek, Really?
Donkey," Really, really."
Shrek, Oh.
Donkey," Man, I like you. What’s your name?"
Shrek," Uh, Shrek."
Donkey," Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don’t-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek’s cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who’d want to live in a place like that?"
Shrek, That would be my home.
Donkey," Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It’s amazing what you’ve done with such a modest budget. [he sees a boulder stuck on the grass] I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. [he continues following Shrek] I guess you don’t entertain much, do you?"
Shrek, I like my privacy.
Donkey," You know, I do too. That’s another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You’ve trying to give them a hint, and they won’t leave. There’s that awkward silence, you know. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?"
Shrek," Uh, what?"
Donkey," Can I stay with you, please?"
Shrek, (sarcastically) Of course!
Donkey, Really?
Shrek, No.
Donkey," Please! I don’t wanna go back there! You don’t know what it’s like to be considered a freak! (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that’s why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!"
Shrek, Okay! Okay! (as he opens the door) But one night only.
Donkey, Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)
Shrek, What are you....? No! No!
Donkey," (he hops up onto the chair) This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin’ manly stories, and in the mornin’ I’m makin’ waffles."
Shrek, (growling) Oh!
Donkey," Where do, uh, I sleep?"
Shrek, (irritated) Outside!
Donkey," Oh, well, I guess that’s cool. I mean, I don’t know you, and you don’t know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I’m a Donkey. I was born outside. I’ll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. ♪ I’m all alone…there’s no one here beside me… ♪"
Shrek, (to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside.
Donkey, (from the window) I am outside.
Gorder, (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.
Shrek," Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.)"
Gorder, (sniffs) I found some cheese. (bites Shrek’s ear)
Shrek, Ow!
Gorder, Bleah! Awful stuff!
Gorder, How did you know?
Shrek," Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead girl off the table."
Dwarf, Where are we supposed to put her? The bed’s taken.
Shrek, Huh?
Big Bad Wolf, What?
Shrek, I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do to get a little privacy?
Big Bad Wolf, Aaaah!
Shrek," Oh, no. Oh, no. No! No!"
Fairy Godmother," [gasping] Oh, dear!"
Dwarf, Whoa!
Donkey," Hey, don’t look at me. I didn’t invite them."
Pinocchio," Oh, gosh, no one invited us."
Shrek, What?
Pinocchio, We were forced to come here.
Shrek, (flabbergasted) By who?
Shrek, (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?
Donkey," Oh, I do! I know where he is!"
Shrek, Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?
Donkey, Me! Me!
Shrek, Anyone?
Donkey," Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!"
Donkey," All right, that’s what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it! ♪ On the road again. ♪ Sing it with me, Shrek. ♪ I can’t wait to get on the road again. ♪"
Shrek, What did I say about singing?
Donkey, Can I whistle?
Shrek, No.
Donkey, Can I hum it?
Shrek," All right, hum it."
GINGERBREAD MAN," Okay, I’ll tell you. (they recite the famous Muffin Man Nursery Rhyme) Do you know the muffin man?"
Shrek, It’s quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?
Donkey," Hey, look at this!"
Clockwork Chorus," Welcome to DuLoc, such a perfect town. Here we have some rules, let us lay them down. Don’t make waves, stay in line and we’ll get along fine. DuLoc is perfect place! Please keep off of the grass. Shine your shoes, wipe your… face! DuLoc is, DuLoc is, DuLoc is a perfect... place!"
Donkey, Wow! Let’s do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again)
Shrek," (grabs Donkey’s tail and holds him still) No! No! No, no, no! No."
Shrek, Exactly the way it was?
Farquaad, Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.
Shrek, And the squatters?
Farquaad, As good as gone.
Shrek, What kind of quest?
Donkey, Let me get this straight. You’re gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don’t have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right?
Shrek," You know, maybe there’s a good reason Donkeys shouldn't talk."
Donkey," I don’t get it. Why don’t you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip."
Shrek," Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village… and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?"
Donkey," Uh, no, not really, no."
Shrek," For your information, there’s a lot more to ogres than people think."
Donkey, Example?
Shrek," Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. (he holds out his onion)"
Donkey, (sniffs the onion) They stink?
Shrek, Yes-- No!
Donkey," Oh, they make you cry?"
Shrek, No!
Donkey," Oh, you leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin’ little white hairs."
Shrek, No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. (he heaves a sigh and then walks off)
Donkey," (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both have layers. Oh. (sniffs the onion) You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers."
Shrek, I don’t care… what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes.
Donkey," You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, ""Hey, let’s get some parfait,"" they say, ""Hell no, I don’t like no parfait""? Parfaits are delicious."
Shrek," NO! YOU DENSE, IRRITATING, MINIATURE BEAST OF BURDEN! OGRES ARE LIKE ONIONS! End of story! Bye-bye! See ya later!"
Donkey, Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole stupid planet.
Shrek," You know, I think I preferred your humming."
Donkey, Do you have a tissue or something? I’m making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start slobbering.
The Proclaimers," ""I’m On My Way""]"
Shrek," Really, really."
Donkey," Okay, don’t look down. Don’t look down. Don’t look down. Keep on moving. Don’t look down. (he steps through a rotting board and ends up looking straight down into the lava) [Gasps] Shrek! I’m lookin’ down! AAH! Oh, God, I can’t do this! Just let me off right now, please!"
Donkey, You afraid?
Shrek, No. But… Shh
Shrek," Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where’s the--"
Donkey, DRAGON!
Fiona, Oh! Oh!
Shrek, Wake up!
Fiona, What?
Shrek, Are you Princess Fiona?
Fiona," I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me."
Shrek," Oh, that’s nice. Now let’s go!"
Shrek," You’ve had a lot of time to plan this, haven’t you?"
Fiona, (smiles) Mm-hmm.
Fiona, But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!
Shrek, I don’t think so.
Shrek, Thanks!
Fiona, What kind of knight are you?
Donkey," Hi, Princess!"
Fiona, It talks!
Shrek, RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
Fiona, But how will you kiss me?
Donkey, Maybe it’s a perk.
Fiona," Well, yes."
Fiona," Of course, you are. You’re my rescuer. Now.... Now remove your helmet."
Shrek, Look. I really don’t think this is a good idea.
Fiona, Just take off the helmet.
Shrek, I’m not going to.
Shrek, Okay! Easy. As your command. Your Highness. (takes off his helmet revealing his face but smudged in a charcoal-like substance)
Fiona, You.... You’re a.... an ogre?
Fiona," Agh! Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down! AAAAARRRRRRGGHH!!!"
Fiona," Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You’re just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad."
Shrek, Hey! Over here.
Shrek, What’s all this about?
Shrek, Princess!
Donkey," Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn’t color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns."
Shrek, (os) Ow!
Donkey," Hold on, Shrek! I’m comin’! (rips a flower off a nearby bush that just happens to be a blue flower with red thorns)"
Shrek, Ow! Not good.
Eels," ""My Beloved Monster""]"
Fiona, I guess I’ll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.
Shrek," Um, Princess?"
Fiona," Yes, Shrek?"
Donkey, It’s very spooky in here. I ain’t playing no games.
Donkey, Aaaah!
Fiona," No, no!"
Donkey," No, help!"
Fiona, Shh!
Donkey, Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Fiona," No, it’s okay. It’s okay."
Donkey, What did you do with the princess?
Fiona," Donkey, shh! I’m the princess."
Donkey, Aah!
Fiona," It’s me, in this body."
Donkey," Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to her stomach) Can you hear me?"
Fiona, Donkey!
Donkey," (still aimed at her stomach) Listen, keep breathing! I’ll get you out of there!"
Fiona, No!
Donkey, Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
Fiona, Shh.
Donkey, Shrek!
Fiona, This is me.
Donkey," (he looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets down.) Princess? What happened to you? You’re, uh, uh, uh, different."
Fiona," I’m ugly, okay?"
Donkey," Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? ‘Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now...."
Fiona, No. I.... I’ve been this way as long as I can remember.
Donkey," What do you mean? Look, I ain’t never seen you like this before."
Fiona," It only happens when sun goes down. ""By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm… until you find true love’s first kiss… and then take love’s true form."""
Donkey," Ah, that’s beautiful. I didn’t know you wrote poetry."
Fiona, Shrek?
Fiona, Shrek. Are you all right?
Shrek, Perfect! Never been better.
Fiona, I.... I don’t.... There’s something I have to tell you.
Shrek," You don’t have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last night."
Fiona, You heard what I said?
Shrek, Every word.
Fiona, I thought you’d understand.
Donkey," What’d I miss? What’d I miss? (he spots the soldiers, mumbling to himself.) Who said that? Couldn’t have been the Donkey."
Farquaad, Princess Fiona.
Shrek, As promised. Now hand it over.
Fiona," No, you’re right. It doesn’t."
Donkey," Shrek, what are you doing? You’re letting her get away."
Shrek, Yeah? So what?
Donkey," Shrek, there’s something about her you don’t know. Look, I talked to her last night, She’s...."
Shrek," I know you talked to her last night. You’re great pals, aren’t ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don’t you follow her home?"
Donkey," Shrek, I.... I wanna go with you."
Shrek," I told you, didn’t I? You’re not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking Donkeys!"
Donkey, But I thought....
Shrek, Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong! (stomps off)
Donkey, Shrek.
John Cale," ""Hallelujah""]"
Shrek, Donkey? (as Donkey ignores him and continues with what he’s doing.) What are you doing?
Donkey," I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one."
Shrek," Well, yeah. But the wall’s supposed to go around my swamp, not through it."
Donkey," It is around your half. See that’s your half, and this is my half."
Shrek, Oh! Your half. Hmm.
Donkey," Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head."
Shrek, (grabs the tree branch Donkey is working with) Back off!
Donkey," No, you back off!"
Shrek, This is my swamp!
Donkey, Our swamp!
Shrek," Let go, Donkey!"
Donkey, You let go!
Shrek, Stubborn stupid!
Donkey, Smelly ogre!
Shrek, Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks away)
Donkey," Hey, hey, come back here. I’m not through with you yet."
Shrek," Well, I’m through with you."
Donkey," Uh-uh. You know, with you it’s always, ""Me, me, me!"" Well, guess what! Now it’s my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me. You insult me and you don’t appreciate anything that I do! You’re always pushing me around or pushing me away."
Shrek," Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?"
Donkey, Because that’s what friends do! They forgive each other!
Shrek," Oh, yeah. You’re right, Donkey. I forgive you… for stabbin’ me in the back! (goes into the outhouse and slams the door)"
Donkey," Ohh! You’re so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you’re afraid of your own feelings."
Shrek, (os) Go away!
Donkey," There you are, doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you."
Shrek," (os) Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of you talking."
Donkey," She wasn’t talkin’ about you. She was talkin’ about, uh, somebody else."
Shrek," (opens the door and comes out) She wasn’t talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?"
Donkey," Uh-uh, no way. I ain’t saying anything. You don’t wanna listen to me. Right? Right?"
Shrek, Donkey!
Donkey, No!
Shrek," Okay, look. I’m sorry, all right? (sigh) I’m sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?"
Donkey," Hey, that’s what friends are for, right?"
Shrek, Right. Friends?
Donkey, Friends.
Shrek," So, um, what did Fiona say about me?"
Donkey, What are you asking me for? Why don’t you just go ask her?
Shrek, The wedding! We’ll never make it in time!
Donkey," Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there’s a will, there’s a way and I have a way. (whistles)"
Shrek, Donkey?
Donkey, I guess it’s just my animal magnetism.
Shrek," Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a noogie)"
Bishop," People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witness to the union…."
Fiona, (eyeing the setting sun) Um....
Bishop, …of our new king…
Fiona," Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the ""I do’s""?"
Farquaad, (chuckles and then motions to the priest to indulge Fiona) Go on.
